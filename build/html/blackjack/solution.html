overview of the key nouns in these sections. We will not review those
nouns already examined for Craps and Roulette.</p>
<p>From the nouns we can start to define some classes. We’ll
present this in <a class="reference internal" href="#preliminary-class-structure">Preliminary Class Structure</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll confirm our notion with a walk-through of parts of a scenario.
We’ll show this in <a class="reference internal" href="#a-walkthrough">A Walkthrough</a>.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="#blackjack-solution-questions-and-answers">Blackjack Solution Questions and Answers</a> we’ll provide some

<h2>Preliminary Survey of Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminary-survey-of-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In reading the background information and the problem statement, we
noticed a number of nouns that seemed to be new to the game of Blackjack.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Card</p></li>
<li><p>Deck</p></li>
<li><p>Point Value</p></li>
<li><p>Hand</p></li>
<li><p>Number Card</p></li>
<li><p>Face Card</p></li>
<li><p>Offer</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance</p></li>
<li><p>Split</p></li>
<li><p>Double</p></li>
<li><p>Hit</p></li>
<li><p>Stand</p></li>
<li><p>Player</p></li>
<li><p>Game</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following table summarizes some of the new classes and
responsibilities that we can identify from the problem statement. This
is not the complete list of classes we need to build. As we work through
the exercises, we’ll discover additional classes and rework some of
these classes more than once.</p>
<p>We also have a legacy of classes available from the Roulette and Craps
solutions. We would like to build on this infrastructure as much as possible.</p>

<span id="blackjack-solution-proc"></span><h2>A Walkthrough<a class="headerlink" href="#a-walkthrough" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The unique, new feature of Blackjack is the more sophisticated
collaboration between the game and the player. This interaction involves
a number of offers for various bets, and bet resolution. Additionally,
it includes offers to double, hit or stand. We’ll examine parts of a
typical sequence of play to assure ourselves that we have all of the
necessary collaborations and responsibilities.</p>
<p>A good way to structure this task is to do a CRC walk-through.
For more information on this technique see <a class="reference internal" href="../roulette/solution.html#roul-solution-walkthrough"><span class="std std-ref">A Walk-Through of Roulette</span></a>.
We’ll present the overall sequence of play, and leave it to the
student to manage the CRC walk-through.</p>
<p class="rubric">Typical Blackjack Game</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Place Bets</strong>.
The Game will ask the Player to place a bet. If the player doesn’t place
a bet, the session is over.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create Hands</strong>.
The Game will deal two cards to the Player’s initial Hand.</p>
<p>The Game will create an initial hand of two cards for the dealer. One of
the cards is the up card, and is visible to the player.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insurance?</strong>
The Game gets the Dealer’s Hand’s up card. If it is an Ace, then
insurance processing is perforemed.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Offer Even Money</strong>.
The Game examines the Player’s hand for two cards totalling a soft 21,
blackjack. If so, the Game offers the Even Money resolution to the
Player. If the player accepts, the entire game is resolved at this
point. The ante is paid at even money; there is no insurance bet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Offer Insurance</strong>.
The Game offers insurance to the Player, who can accept by creating a
bet. For players with blackjack, this is a second offer after even money
is declined. If the player declines, there are no further insurance considerations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examine Hole Card</strong>.
The Game examines the Dealer’s Hand’s hole card. If is is a 10-point
value, the insurance bet is resolved as a winner, the ante is resolved
as a loser, and for this player, the game is over. Otherwise the
insurance is resolved as a loser, the hole card is not revealed, and
play will continue. Note that in a casino with multiple players, it is
possible for a player declining insurance to continue to play with the
dealer’s hole card revealed. For casinos that offer “early surrender”
this is the time to surrender.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Split?</strong>
The Game examines the Player’s Hand to see if the two cards are of equal
rank. If so, it offers a split. The player accepts by creating an
additional Bet. The original hand is removed; The Game splits the two
original Cards then deals two additional Cards to create two new Hands.</p>
<p>Some casinos prevent further splitting, others allow continued splitting
of the resulting hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Play Out Player Hands</strong>.
The following are done to play out each of the Player’s Hands.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Bust? Double? Hit? Stand?</strong>
While the given Hand is under 21 points, the Game must extend three
kinds of offers to the Player. If the Player accepts a Hit, the hand
gets another card and this process repeats.</p>
<p>If the Player accepts Double Down, the player must create an additional
bet, and the hand gets one more card and play is done. If the Player
Stands Pat, the play is done. If the hand is 21 points or over, play is done.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Resolve Bust</strong>.
The Game must examine each Hand; if it is over 21, the Hand is resolved
as a loser.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Play Out Dealer Hand</strong>.
The Game then examines the Dealer Hand and deals Cards on a point value
of 16 or less, and stops dealing Cards cards on point value of 17 or more.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Dealer Bust?</strong>
The Game then examines the Dealer Hand to see if it is over 21. If so,
the player’s bets are resolved as winners. Player Hands with two cards
totalling 21 ( “blackjack” ) are paid 3:2, all other hands are
paid 1:1.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Compare Hands</strong>.
For each hand still valid, the Game compares the Player’s Hand point
value against the Dealer’s Hand point value. Higher point value wins. In
the case of a tie, it is a push and the bet is returned.</p>
<p>When the Player wins, a winning hand with two cards totalling 21 (“blackjack”)
is paid 3:2, any other winning hand is paid 1:1.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Blackjack Solution Questions and Answers<a class="headerlink" href="#blackjack-solution-questions-and-answers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Will we really need both <a class="reference internal" href="card_deck_shoe.html#Deck" title="Deck"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Deck</span></code></a> and the multiple deck <a class="reference internal" href="card_deck_shoe.html#Shoe" title="Shoe"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Shoe</span></code></a>?
Wouldn’t it be simpler to combine this functionality into a single class?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are two separate responsibilities here. The deck owns the basic
responsibility to build the 52 cards. The shoe, on the other hand, owns
the responsibility to deal cards to hands without dealing all of the
available cards. Typically, 52 to 104 cards are held back from play.</p>
<p>We want to be able to simulate games with 1 to 8 decks. A single deck
game can simply deal directly from the deck. In a multi-deck game, all
of the decks are shuffled together and loaded into a small box (called a “shoe”)
for dealing. The difference between one deck and a five-deck shoe is
that the shoe can produce 20 kings in a row. While rare, our simulation
does need to cover situations like this.</p>
<p>Also, we may want to build a slightly different shoe that simulates the
continuous shuffling machine that some casinos use. In this case, each
hand is reshuffled back into the shoe, preventing any attempt at card
counting. We don’t want to disturb the basic, common deck when
introducing this additional feature.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Won’t all those player interactions break our design?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>That’s unlikely. All of the player interactions are in addition to the <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">placeBets()</span></code>
interface. Since we’ve separated the core features of all players from
the game-specific features, we can add a subclass to player that will be
handle the Blackjack interaction. This new player subclass will have a
number of additional methods to handle insurance, even money, split and
the regular play questions of hit, double and stand.</p>
<p>In parallel, we’ve separated the core features of all games from the
unique features for a specific game. We can now add a subclass for
Blackjack which adds a number of methods to offer insurance, even money,
split and the regular play questions of hit, double and stand to the
Blackjack player.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I can’t find an Outcome in Blackjack. Is it the Ante? If so, the odds
vary based on the player’s Hand, but that doesn’t seem to be a RandomEvent.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Good point. We’ll examine this in detail in the exercises. Clearly, the
bets are placed on the Ante and Insurance as the two core <a class="reference internal" href="../roulette/outcome.html#Outcome" title="Outcome"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Outcome</span></code></a> objects
in Blackjack. The Insurance outcome (really a “dealer has blackjack”
outcome) is fixed at <img class="math" src="../_images/math/2da4d58abd68781dcdd0b97ac1adbaaf01695038.png" alt="2:1"/>. The ante payoff depends on a complex condition
of the hand: for a soft 21, or blackjack, it pays <img class="math" src="../_images/math/121f5f29be8f0ec9829a4d65d8dd52ff5f14eb1c.png" alt="3:2"/>; otherwise it pays
1:1. This will lead to a new subclass of the <a class="reference internal" href="../roulette/outcome.html#Outcome" title="Outcome"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Outcome</span></code></a> class that
collaborates with the hand to determine the payout to use.</p>
<p>The “even money” is offered before ordinary insurance to a player
with blackjack. It, however, pays even money on the ante, and doesn’t
create a new bet; in this respect it could be thought of as a change in
the outcome on which the ante bet is created. Accepting the even money
offer is a little bit like moving the ante to a “even money for
dealer blackjack” outcome, which has 1:1 odds instead of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/121f5f29be8f0ec9829a4d65d8dd52ff5f14eb1c.png" alt="3:2"/> odds.
Further, this special outcome is resolved before the dealer peeks at
their hole card. Perhaps this is a special best resolution procedure,
not a proper instance of the <a class="reference internal" href="../roulette/outcome.html#Outcome" title="Outcome"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Outcome</span></code></a> class.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>Looking Forward<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-forward" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first part of the design for Blackjack requires a design for handling
cards, and the randomizer subclasses that model the deck and the dealering shoe.
We’ll look at all of these closely-related classes in the next chapter.</p>
