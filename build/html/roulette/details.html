<p>We’ll start out by looking a the game of Roulette in <a class="reference internal" href="#roulette-game">Roulette Game</a>.
This will focus on Roulette as played in most American casinos.</p>
<p>We will follow this with <a class="reference internal" href="#available-bets-in-roulette">Available Bets in Roulette</a>. There are a profusion
of bets available in Roulette. Most of the sophisticated betting strategies
focus on just one of the even-money bets.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="#some-betting-strategies">Some Betting Strategies</a>, we will describe some common betting strategies that we will
simulate. The betting strategies are interesting and moderately complex
algorithms for changing the amount that is used for each bet in an
attempt to recoup losses.</p>
<p>We’ll also include some additional topics in <a class="reference internal" href="#roulette-details-questions-and-answers">Roulette Details Questions and Answers</a>.</p>

<span id="roul-details-game"></span><h2>Roulette Game<a class="headerlink" href="#roulette-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The game of Roulette centers around a wheel with
thirty-eight numbered bins. The numbers include 0, 00
(double zero), and 1 through 36. The table has a surface marked
with spaces on which players can place bets. The spaces
include the 38 numbers, plus a bewildering variety of additional bets,
which will be detailed below.</p>
<p>The “bewildering” is important. Not all of the available bets
are clearly identified on the layout.</p>
<p>After the bets are placed by the players,
the wheel is spun by the house, a small ball is dropped into the
spinning wheel. When the wheel stops spinning, the ball will come to
rest in one of the thirty-eight numbered bins, defining the winning
number. The winning number and all of the related winning bets are paid
off; the losing bets are collected. The payouts vary with the
likelihood of the outcome.</p>
<p>The numbers from 1 to 36 are colored red and black in an arbitrary
pattern. They fit into various ranges, as well as being even or odd,
which defines many of the winning bets related to a given number. The
numbers 0 and 00 are colored green, they fit into none of the ranges,
and are considered to be neither even nor odd. There are relatively few
bets related to the zeroes. The geometry of the betting locations on the
table defines the relationships between clusters of number bets: a group of numbers
is given a colorful name like a street or a corner.</p>

<p>American Rules</p>
<p>There are slight variations in Roulette between American and
European casinos. We’ll focus strictly on the American version.</p>

<span id="roul-details-bets"></span><h2>Available Bets in Roulette<a class="headerlink" href="#available-bets-in-roulette" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a variety of bets available on the Roulette table. Each bet
has a payout, which is stated as <img class="math" src="../_images/math/8665e25c6c0a1a67649988a49e2cc454b45befa4.png" alt="n:1"/> where <img class="math" src="../_images/math/5a939c5280da7202ca4531f175a7780ad5e1f80a.png" alt="n"/> is
the multiplier that defines the amount won based on the amount bet.</p>
<p>A $5 bet at 2:1 will win $10. After being paid, there will be $15
sitting on the table, the original $5 bet, plus the $10 additional winnings.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Odds</p>
<p>Not all games state their odds using this convention. Some games
state the odds as “2 <em>for</em> 1”. This means that the
total left on the table after the bets are paid will be two times
the original bet. So a $5 bet will win $5, there will be $10 sitting
on the table.</p>
<p>Yes. This is designed to confuse the players.</p>
</div>
<p>Here’s an image of a common layout of the betting area on a Roulette table.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id1">
<img alt="../_images/Roulette2.png" src="../_images/Roulette2.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Roulette Table Layout</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>The table is divided into two classes of bets. The “inside” bets
are the 38 numbers and small groups of numbers; these bets all have
relatively high odds. The “outside” bets are large groups of
numbers, and have relatively low odds.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of all of the available bets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A “straight bet” is a bet on a single number. There are 38
possible bets, and they pay odds of 35 to 1. Each bin on the wheel
pays one of the straight bets.</p></li>
<li><p>A “split bet” is a bet on an adjacent pair of numbers. For example, 5 is adjacent to 8.
The bet pays 17:1. The table layout has the numbers arranged sequentially in
three columns and twelve rows. Adjacent numbers are in the same row
or column.
Each bin on the wheel pays from two to four of the available split
bets. A bet placed on the line between 5 and 8 will be a winner
if the ball lands in either the 5 bin or the 8 bin.</p></li>
<li><p>A “street bet” includes the three numbers in a single row,
which pays 11:1. There are twelve of these bets on the table.
The chips are placed at the end of the street. There’s no marking
on the table.
When any one of the three bins wins, the street bet is also a winner.</p></li>
<li><p>A square of four numbers is called a “corner bet” and pays
8:1. There are 22 of these bets available. The chips are placed
at the intersection, overlapping the four numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>At one end of the layout, it is possible to place a bet on the Five
numbers 0, 00, 1, 2 and 3. This bet pays 6:1. It is the only combination
bet that includes 0 or 00. The chips are placed on the intersection
of the zeroes and the 2.</p></li>
<li><p>A “line bet” is a six number block, which pays 5:1. It is
essentially two adjacent street bets. There are 11 such combinations.
The chips are placed to overlap two adjacent street bets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The other bets are called “outside” bets. Each of these involves
a group of twelve to eighteen related numbers. None of these outside
bets includes 0 or 00. The only way to bet on 0 or 00 is to place a
straight bet on the number itself, or use the five-number combination bet.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of outside bets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Any of the three 12-number ranges (1-12, 13-24, 25-36) pays 2:1.
There are just three of these bets.</p></li>
<li><p>Any of the three 12-number columns at 2:1 odds. All of
the numbers in a given column have the same remainder when divided
by three. Column 1 contains 1, 4, 7, etc., all of which have a
remainder of 1 when divided by 3.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two 18-number ranges: 1-18 is called “low”,
19-36 is called “high”. These are called even money bets
because they pay at 1:1 odds.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual numbers are colored red or black in an arbitrary
pattern. Note that 0 and 00 are colored green. The bets on red or
black are even money bets, which pay at 1:1 odds.</p></li>
<li><p>The numbers (other than 0 and 00) are also either even or odd. These
bets are also even money bets.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Odds and Payouts</p>
<p id="roul-bg-odds">Not all of the Roulette outcomes are equal probability. Let’s
compare a split bet on 1-2 and an even money
bet on red. Here are the two bets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The split bet wins if either 1 or 2 comes up on the wheel.
This is 2 of the 38 outcomes, or a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/da4dbf6b49bee7d4d2d983e411dc288c50570a7f.png" alt="\tfrac{1}{19}"/> probability, 5.26%.</p></li>
<li><p>The red bet wins if any of the 18 red numbers come up on the
wheel. The is 18 of the 38 outcomes, or a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/84e9c6d17e571331f19569532c2ea0e8df9ab715.png" alt="\tfrac{9}{19}"/> probability, 47.4%.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, the red bet is going to win almost ten times more often
than the 1-2 bet. As an inducement to place bets on rare
occurrences, the house offers a higher payout on those bets.
Since the 1-2 split bet wins is so rarely, they will pay 17
times tge bet. On the other hand, since the red bet wins so
frequently, they will only pay back the amount of the bet.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the odds of winning the 1-2 split bet is 1
chance in 19, but they pay 17 times the bet. Since the bet
is still sitting on the table, it looks like 18 times the amount.
It still isn’t 19 times the original bet. This discrepancy between the
actual probability and the payout odds is sometimes called the
<em>house edge</em>.</p>
<p>The edge varies widely among the various bets
in the game of Roulette. For example, the 5-way bet has <img class="math" src="../_images/math/6f6e5a043d1d7aed53363e23da4a7f3f33df4df8.png" alt="\tfrac{5}{38}"/>
ways of winning, but pays only 6:1. There is only a 13.2% chance
of winning, but they pay as if the outcome had a 16.7% chance,
keeping the 3.5% difference.</p>
<p>Similarly, there’s a 5.26% chance to win a
split bet, but the house pays as if it were a 5.88% chance, a
.62% discrepancy in the odds.</p>
<p>The smallest discrepancy between actual chances of winning
(47.4%) and the payout odds (50%) is available on the even money
bets: red, black, even, odd, high or low. All the betting
systems that we will look at focus on these bets alone, since
the house edge is the smallest.</p>

<div class="section" id="some-betting-strategies">
<span id="roul-details-betting"></span><h2>Some Betting Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#some-betting-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps because Roulette is a relatively simple game, elaborate betting
systems have evolved around it. Searches on the Internet turn up a many
copies of the same basic descriptions for a number of betting systems.
Our purpose is not to uncover the actual history of these systems, but
to exploit them for simple OO design exercises. Feel free to
research additional betting systems or invent your own.</p>
<p><strong>Martingale</strong>.
The Martingale system starts with a base wagering amount, <em>w</em>,
and a count of the number of losses, <em>c</em>, initially 0. Each
loss doubles the bet.</p>
<p>Any given spin will place an amount of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/4e8eac92be398003c900a8551a2cfffa9e87c2ba.png" alt="w \times 2^{c}"/>
on a 1:1 proposition (for example, red).
When a bet wins, the loss count is reset to zero; resetting the bet to
the base amount, <em>w</em>. This assures that a single win will
recoup all losses.</p>
<p>Note that the casinos effectively prevent successful use of this system
by imposing a table limit. At a $10 Roulette table, the limit may be as
low as $1,000. A Martingale bettor who lost six times in a row would be
facing a $640 bet, and after the seventh loss, their next bet would
exceed the table limit. At that point, the player is unable to recoup
all of their losses. Seven losses in a row is only a 1 in 128
probability; making this a relatively likely situation.</p>
<p><strong>Waiting</strong>.
Another system is to wait until some number of losses have elapsed. For
example, wait until the wheel has spun seven reds in a row, and then bet
on black. This can be combined with the Martingale system to double the
bet on each loss as well as waiting for seven reds before betting on black.</p>
<p>This “wait for a favorable state” strategy is based on a confusion between the outcome of each
individual spin and the overall odds of given collections of spins.
If the wheel has spun seven reds in a row, it’s “due” to spin black.</p>
<p><strong>1-3-2-6 System</strong>.
Another betting system is called the 1-3-2-6 system. The
idea is to avoid the doubling of the bet at each loss and running into
the table limit. Rather than attempt to recoup all losses in a single
win, this system looks to recoup all losses by waiting for four wins in
a row.</p>
<p>The sequence of numbers (1, 3, 2 and 6) are the multipliers to
use when placing bets after winning. At each loss, the sequence resets
to the multiplier of 1. At each win, the multiplier is advanced through
the sequence. After one win, the bet is now <img class="math" src="../_images/math/1d0c944ebd3ba1406069bec1a955b6017d54f1d2.png" alt="3w"/>. After a
second win, the bet is reduced to <img class="math" src="../_images/math/6bd25a466db76b2ebc1ae90f920a17661757cb13.png" alt="2w"/>, and the winnings of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/1c5ef48178911a8e836b026600538362463a1b26.png" alt="4w"/>
are “taken down” or removed from play. In the event
of a third win, the bet is advanced to <img class="math" src="../_images/math/ac8d968707cc0ee49a8aa6c78586212b54599305.png" alt="6w"/>. Should there be
a fourth win, the player has doubled their money, and the sequence resets.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation</strong>.
Another method for tracking the lost bets is called the Cancellation
system or the <em>Labouchere</em> system. The player starts with a
betting budget allocated as a series of numbers. The usual example is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
<p>Each bet is sum of the first and last numbers in the last. In this
case 1+9 is 10. At a win, cancel the two numbers used to make the
bet. In the event of all the numbers being cancelled, reset the
sequence of numbers and start again. For each loss, however, add the
amount of the bet to the end of the sequence as a loss to be recouped.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the cancellation system using
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Bet 1+9. A win. Cancel 1 and 9, leaving
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Bet 2+8. A loss. Add 10, leaving
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Bet 2+10. A loss. Add 12, leaving
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12.</p></li>
<li><p>Bet 2+12. A win. Cancel 2 and 12, leaving
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Next bet will be 3+10.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Fibonacci</strong>.
A player could use the Fibonacci Sequence to structure a
series of bets in a kind of cancellation system. The Fibonacci Sequence is
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …</p>
<p>At each loss, the sum of the previous two bets – the next numbers
in the sequence – becomes the new bet amount. In the event of a
win, we simply revert to the base betting amount. This allows
the player to easily track their accumulated losses, with bets that
could recoup those losses through a series of wins.</p>

<div class="section" id="roulette-details-questions-and-answers">
<h2>Roulette Details Questions and Answers<a class="headerlink" href="#roulette-details-questions-and-answers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do the house limits really have an impact on play?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The snarky answer is “Of course they do, or the house wouldn’t impose them.”</p>
<p>Many betting strategies increase bets on a loss,
in an effort to break even or get slightly ahead. How many losses can occur
in a row?</p>
<p>The answer is “indefinite.” The odds of a long series of losses
get less and less probable, but it never becomes zero.</p>
<p>For a simple <img class="math" src="../_images/math/42929609166036668f7017bcc014c9adcec07636.png" alt="P = .5"/> event – like flipping a coin – we can
often see three heads in a row. One head is <img class="math" src="../_images/math/2bdc5d7d0d0a32591496f96d524770442d63e0cd.png" alt="P(\text{h}) = .5"/>.
Two heads is <img class="math" src="../_images/math/5acc85aaf25c97387c924b97ac6909ba7d0ea333.png" alt="P(\text{h},\text{h}) = .5 \times .5 = 0.25"/>. If we partition a sequence of
coin tosses into pairs, we expect that 1 of 4 pairs will have two heads.</p>
<p>Three heads is <img class="math" src="../_images/math/eabc611396fd591175b10da9da0e8cf02643a04b.png" alt="P(\text{h},\text{h},\text{h}) = .5 \times .5 \times .5 = 0.125"/>.
If we partition a sequence of coin tosses into threes, we expect that 1 of 8 triples
will have three heads.</p>
<p>A table limit that’s 30 times the base bet, say $300 at a $10 table,
is a way of capping play at an event has a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/8ee6f57c5191fc8500d354e28879bf3ad08aee46.png" alt="P = \dfrac{1}{30} = 0.033"/>.
Three percent is the odds of seeing five heads in a row.  If we double the bet
on each loss, we’d only need to see five losses in a row to reach the table
limit.</p>
<p>This three percent limit is in line with our ways the house maintains an edge
in each game.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Why are there so many bets in Roulette?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is a universal feature of gambling. A lot of different kinds of bets
allows a player to imagine that one of those bets is better than the others.</p>
<p>Many of the betting strategies leverage the simplest of bets: a nearly
even-money proposition like red, black, even, odd, high, or low. These
are easy to analyze because they’re (nearly) <img class="math" src="../_images/math/42929609166036668f7017bcc014c9adcec07636.png" alt="P = .5"/> and the
cost of a series of losses or a series of wins is easy to compute.</p>
<p>When we look at Craps, the core bet – the “pass line” – is also nearly
<img class="math" src="../_images/math/42929609166036668f7017bcc014c9adcec07636.png" alt="P = .5"/>, allowing the use of similar betting strategies.</p>
<p>The idea of the various betting strategies, then, is to avoid all
of the complexity and focus on a simple bet. For the most part,
our <a class="reference internal" href="player.html#Player" title="Player"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Player</span></code></a> implementations can follow this approach.</p>
<p>However, if we implement the complete game, we can write <a class="reference internal" href="player.html#Player" title="Player"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Player</span></code></a>
that make a number of different kinds of bets to see how the house
edge breaks the various betting strategies.</p>
