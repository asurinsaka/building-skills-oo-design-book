    preface

Getting Started
===============

In this part, we'll look at some general topics required to
get started. The first chapter will provide some foundations,
talking about the problem domain, the solution, and some general
ideas on how the work will proceed.

The remaining chapters will provide specific guidance on setting
up a working development environment, writing some basic unit
tests, and starting down the road to producing useful documentation.
These sections will set the stage for all of the work which follows.

..  _`roul`:

Roulette
========

Roulette is a stateless game
with numerous bets and a very simple process for game play.

The chapters of this part present the details on the game, an overview
of the solution, and a series of sixteen exercises to build a complete
simulation of the game, plus a variety of betting strategies. Each
exercise chapter builds at least one class, plus unit tests; in some
cases, this includes rework of previous deliverables.

..  _`craps`:

Craps
==========

This part describes parts of the more complex game of Craps.  Craps
is played with dice.
Craps is a game with two states and a number of state-change rules. It has a
variety betting alternatives, some of which are quite complex.

The chapters of this part presents the details on the game, an overview
of the solution, and a series of eleven exercises to build a complete
simulation of the game, with a variety of betting strategies. The
exercises in this part are more advanced; unlike :ref:`roul`, we will
often combine several classes into a single batch of deliverables.

There are several examples of rework in this part, some of them quite
extensive. This kind of rework reflects three more advanced scenarios:
refactoring to generalize and add features, renaming to rationalize the
architecture, and refactoring to extract features. Each of these is the
result of learning; they are design issues that can't easily be located
or explained in advance.

..  _`blackjack`:

Blackjack
==========

This part describes the more complex game of Blackjack.
This game has a
number of states and a number of complex state-change rules.
While the betting rules are simple, the game play is more complex.

The chapters of this part presents the details on the game, an overview
of the solution, and a series of six relatively complex exercises to
build a complete simulation of the game. In the case of Blackjack, we
have to create a design that allows for considerable variation in the
rules of the game as well as variation in the player's betting strategies.

..  _`finish`:

Fit and Finish
==============

A finished application includes more than just a collection of packages.
We'll need to build a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to operate this program.
This isn't a sophisticated OO design problem. This is a collection
of exercises in using the standard library to create the final
application.
