Python Unit Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python :mod:`unittest` module encourages us to build a test module
separate from the application class we're testing. The test module will
have one more more :class:`TestCase` classes, each of which has one
or more test methods.

In `Using Unit Tests`_ we'll look at an overall development process
that leverages unit tests as a way to write testable specifications.

In `Dependencies`_ we'll touch briefly on testing dependent classes
together or creating mock objects.

We'll look at an example in `Example Unit Test`_. To be complete,
we'll show the class which was tested in `Example Class Definition`_.

In `Python doctest Testing`_ we'll look at how we can execute the test cases
in the document strings of a module, class, function, or method.

In `Building Doctest Examples`_ we'll show how we can take
interactive Python output and transform it into a doctest example.
This will involve copy and paste. It's not too challenging.

In `Mixed unittest and doctest`_ we'll show how we can combine unittest
tests with doctest tests.

Using Unit Tests
================

One approach to unit testing is to build the tests first, then write a
class which at least doesn't crash, but may not pass all the tests. Once
we have this in place, we can now debug the tests until everything looks
right. This is called test-driven development.

We'd start with unittest files in the :file:`test` directory of our
project. In this case, we'd have :file:`testCard.py` and :file:`testDeck.py`.
We also need skeleton files in our :class:`src` directory: :class:`cards.py`
and :class:`deck.py`.

Generally, the process for creating a class with the unit tests has the following outline.

1.  Write a skeleton for the class that's the :phrase:`Unit Under Test` (:abbrev:`UUT`).
    This class that doesn't really do anything,
    but at least compiles and has the right method names.

2.  Write the test class.  This will create instances of the class under test,
    exercise those instances, and make assertions about the state of those instances.
    The test class may create mocks for the various collaborators of the
    target class.

3.  Run the test, knowing that the first few attempts will fail.
    Sometimes our class under test is so simple
    that we get it right the first time.  Other times, the class under test is more complex
    and there are parts we didn't finish when we wrote the skeleton version.

4.  While at least one test is failing.

    a.  Refactor.  We finish our target class.  Sometimes we simply fill in the missing
        parts.  Other times, we have more serious design work to do.

    b.  Run the test suite.

5.  At this point, the  class under test passes the suite of tests.  However, it may still
    fail to meet other quality criteria.  For example, it may have a convoluted
    structure, or it may be inefficient, or it may lack appropriate documentation.
    In any case, we're not really done with development.

6.  While our target class fails to meet our quality standards.

    a.  Refactor.  We correct the quality problems in our target class.

    b.  Run the test suite.  If we have refactored properly, the tests still
        pass.  If we have introduced a problem, tests will fail.

**Using unittest**.
A test runner will locate all the :class:`TestCase` instances, execute them
and summarize the pass/fail status of each individual test method.

Generally, the useful modules will be in package with a name like :file:`casino_sim`.
The test modules will be in a separate package named :file:`test`.

We might have something like this::

    casino_sim
        __main__.py
        common.py
        roulette.py
        craps.py
        blackjack.py
    test
        __main__.py
        test_common.py
        test_roulette.py
        test_craps.py
        test_blackjack.py

(This isn't a requirement, it's just a notion.
In many cases, we'll want to subdivide each game into
game and player modules because they evolve independently.)

Here is an example of running a test from the command
line.

..  code-block:: sh

    python3 -m unittest test.test_blackjack.TestDeck
    ..
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

    OK




Dependencies
=============

Let's assume we've built two classes in some chapter; for example, we're building
:class:`Card` and :class:`Deck`. One class defines a standard
playing card and the other class deals individual card instances. We
need unit tests for each class.

Generally, unit tests are taken to mean that a class is tested in
isolation. In our case, a unit test for Card is completely isolated because
it has no dependencies.

However, our Deck class depends on Card, leading us to make a choice.
Either we have to create a Mock Card that can be used to test Deck
in complete isolation, or our Deck test will depend on both Deck and
Card. The choice depends on the relative complexity of Card, and whether
or not Deck and Card will evolve independently.

Some folks demand that **all** testing be done in "complete" isolation with
a lot of mock classes.  Other folks are less strict on this, recognizing
that Deck and Card are very tightly coupled and Card is very simple.
The Mock Card is almost as complex as Card.

Example Unit Test
==================

..  rubric:: test_card.py

..  include:: ../../code/test_card.py
    :code: python

#.  Generally, we create a number of object instances in the
    setup method. In this case, we created five distinct
    :class:`Card` instances. These object constructors
    imply several things in our :class:`Card`
    class.

    a.  There will be a set of manifest constants for the suits:
        :obj:`Clubs`, :obj:`Diamonds`,
        :obj:`Hearts` and
        :obj:`Spades`.

    b.  The constructor (:meth:`Card.__init__`) will accept a rank and a suit
        constant.

    Note that we didn't write tests to create all suits or all
    ranks. In same cases, we may need to produce tests which exhaustively
    enumerate all possibe alternatives. We may also want to include
    :phrase:`edge and corner` cases like trying to create an :class:`AceCard`
    with a rank of 2.

    For the purposes of learning
    OO design, we only need to sketch out our class by defining the
    tests it must pass. We sometimes call these :phrase:`happy path` test
    cases.

#.  In :meth:`testString`, we exercise the
    :meth:`__str__` method of the
    :class:`Card` class to be sure that it formats cards
    correctly. These tests tell us what the formatting algorithm will
    look like.

#.  In :meth:`testOrder`, we exercise some comparison methods of the
    :class:`Card` class to be sure that it compares card
    ranks correctly. Note that we have explicitly claimed that the
    equality test only checks the rank and ignores the suit; this is
    typical for Blackjack, but won't work well for Bridge or
    Solitaire.

    Note that we didn't exhaustively test all possible
    comparisons among the four cards we defined. We tested enough
    to be sure we had an implementation that was good enough to
    get started.

#.  This is the standard main program for a :class:`unittest` module.
    We often include this in each test module. We'll also include
    a :mod:`__main__` module that includes all of the tests into
    a master test suite.

Example Class Definition
========================

Our initial :class:`Card` class needs to have just enough of an API to allow the
tests to run. Here's our skeleton :class:`Card` class.

..  rubric::  blackjack.py

..  include:: ../../code/blackjack.py
    :code: python
    :start-line: 9
    :end-line: 70

This class will -- minimally -- participate in the testing. It won't
pass many tests, but it serves as a basis for developing the class implementation.

Note that there's almost no documentation in this class.
We'll address that gap in :ref:`documentation`.

Python :application:`doctest` Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python :application:`doctest`  module requires us to put our test cases
and expected results into the docstring comments on a class, method
or function.  The test case information becomes a formal part of the API
documentation.  When a docstring includes doctest comments, the string
serves dual duty as formal test and a working example.

**Workflow**.
To use   :application:`doctest` is to build the class, exercise it in the
Python interpreter, then put snippets of the interactive log into our
docstrings.

Generally, we follow this outline.

1.  Write and debug the class, including docstring comments.

2.  Exercise the class in an interactive Python interpreter.
    You can use :application:`IDLE` or any other command line.

3.  Copy the snippets out of the interactive log.  Paste them into
    the docstring comments.

4.  Run doctest to be sure that you've copied and pasted correctly.


**Using Doctest**.
There are two ways to use doctest.

Start with Python 2.6, you can run doctest from the command line like this.

..  rubric:: Running Doctest from the Command Line

..  code-block:: sh

    python -m doctest -v roulette.py

You can also add a test function to a module which runs doctest on the module.
This test function should have a name which begins with :literal:`_` to make it
a name that's private to the module and not part fo the module's interface.

..  rubric:: Running Doctest Within a Module

..  include:: ../../code/blackjack_doctest.py
    :code: python
    :start-line: 144

This :func:`_test` function is the main function of the module, so that when
you run the module, it performs it's internal doctests.

..  rubric:: Running A Module with Doctest

..  code-block:: sh

    python roulette.py


**Test-Driven Development**.
Note that the strict test-driven development (:abbrev:`TDD`)
approach to unit testing is to build the tests first, then write a
class which at least doesn't crash, but may not pass all the tests. Once
we have this in place, we can now debug the tests until everything looks
right. This is called test-driven development, because the test cases
come first, driving the rest of the work.

The test-driven approach doesn't fit well with :class:`doctest`.
It's very difficult to develop the test output without having the class
available to exercise interactively. Also, we don't want to put
comprehensive test scripts into our class docsting; they can easily get
too long to be useful.

Also, it's difficult to "fake" the interactive log when designing the
class.  It's usually simpler to have a working class and then add
test cases.

Finally, we need to pick essential features for
demonstration in the doctest comments. We can't easily write comprehensive tests
that cover all features or all line of code in doctest comments.


Building Doctest Examples
=========================

Let's assume we've built two classes; for example, :class:`Card` and :class:`Deck`.
One class defines a standard
playing card and the other class deals individual card instances. We'll
define some minimal doctests.

The first step is to develop our baseline class. See `Example Class Definition`_
for a version of the blackjack module with the :class:`Card` class definition
that we might start with.

**Exercise the Class**.
Once we have the class, we need to exercise it using interactive Python.
Here's what we saw.


..  code-block:: python

    MacBookPro-SLott:OODesign-3.1 slott$ python3
    Python 3.4.3 (v3.4.3:9b73f1c3e601, Feb 23 2015, 02:52:03)
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from blackjack import Card, AceCard, FaceCard
    >>> c2d = Card(2, Card.Diamonds)
    >>> str(c2d)
    ' 2♢'
    >>> cas = AceCard(Card.Ace, Card.Spades)
    >>> str(cas)
    ' A♠'
    >>> cas.softValue
    11

During our session, we played with the preferred use
cases for our class. We can copy the examples from the interactive session and
paste them into our class docstrings.


**Update the Docstrings**.
After we have some output that shows correct behavior of our class, we
can put that output into the class docstrings. Here's our updated :file:`card.py`
module with doctest comments.


..  rubric:: blackjack.py With Doctests Included

..  include:: ../../code/blackjack_doctest.py
    :code: python
    :start-line: 5
    :end-line: 16

..  include:: ../../code/blackjack_doctest.py
    :code: python
    :start-line: 84
    :end-line: 92

We've only shown the docstrings from two classes within
the overall module file.

In both cases, we've copied and pasted lines from
an interactive session to show show the class definitions
shold behave.  When we process this module with
:mod:`doctest` we can confirm that the advertised behavior
matches the actual behavior of the classes.

Mixed :class:`unittest` and :class:`doctest`
====================================================

A more complete approach is to use :class:`unittest` for most
testing and :class:`doctest` to emphasize specific use cases in the
docstrings. When doing this, you'll have a test module that looks
something like the following.


..  rubric::  combined_test.py

..  include:: ../../code/combined_test.py
    :code: python

We've imported :mod:`unittest` and :mod:`doctest` because we'll be
executing a combined suite of tests.

We've imported the :mod:`blackjack_doctest` module. This is an
example that *includes* doctests in the comments. We have a separate
example that doesn't include an doctests in the comments.

We've also imported the :mod:`test_card` module that performs
unit tests on the class definitions in the :mod:`blackjack` module.

We can the build a test suite from these two sources of tests:

-   The doctest strings in the module, and

-   The unit tests :class:`TestCase` classes in the test module.

Between the two sources, we have eight separate tests.

Our :file:`test/__main__.py` module will often use this technique
to build a complete suite of tests incorporating unittest and doctest
tests.
