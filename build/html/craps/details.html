<p>In the first section of this chapter, <a class="reference internal" href="#craps-game-overview">Craps Game Overview</a>,
we will present elements of the game of Craps.
Craps is a stateful game, and we’ll describe the state changes in some detail.</p>
<p>We’ll look at the way dice work in <a class="reference internal" href="#creating-a-dice-frequency-distribution">Creating A Dice Frequency Distribution</a>.</p>
<p>We will review some of the bets available on the Craps table in some
depth in <a class="reference internal" href="#available-bets">Available Bets</a>. Craps offers some very obscure bets, and part of this obscurity
stems from the opaque names for the various bets. Creating this wide
variety of bets is an interesting programming exercise, and the first
four exercise chapters will focus on this.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="#some-betting-strategies">Some Betting Strategies</a> we will describe some common betting strategies that we will
simulate. The betting strategies described in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#roul"><span class="std std-ref">Roulette</span></a> will be
applied to Craps bets, forcing us to examine the Roulette solution for
reuse opportunities.</p>
<p>We’ll also look at an alternative set of bets in <a class="reference internal" href="#wrong-betting">Wrong Betting</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="craps-game-overview">
<span id="craps-details-game-rules"></span><h2>Craps Game Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#craps-game-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Craps centers around a pair of six-sided dice. The 36
combinations form eleven numbers from 2 to 12; additionally, if the two
die have equal values, this is called a “hardways,” because the
number was made “the hard way”.</p>
<p>The table in the casino has a
surface marked with spaces on which players can place bets.
The names of the bets are opaque, and form an obscure jargon. There are
several broad classification of bets, including the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>those which follow the sequence of dice throws that make up a complete game,</p></li>
<li><p>the propositions based on only the next throw of the dice,</p></li>
<li><p>some “hardways” bets on rolling an equal pair before the game is revolved, and,</p></li>
<li><p>some unmarked bets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These bets will be defined more completely, below, under <a class="reference internal" href="#craps-details-bets"><span class="std std-ref">Available Bets</span></a>.</p>
<p>After the bets are placed, the dice are thrown by one of the players.
This number resolves any one-roll bets into immediate winners or losers; it
also determines the state change in the game, which may also resolve any
game-based bets.</p>
<p>The first roll of the dice in a given game can be an
immediate win or loss, or it can establish the point
for the following rounds of this game. Subsequent rolls either make the
point and win the game, roll a seven and lose the game, or the game
continues. When the game is won, the winning player continues to shoot;
a losing player passes the dice around the table to the next player.</p>
<p>Note that a game is of indefinite length. Less likely point values (4 and 10)
will have longer games. More likely point values (6 and 8) will have
shorter games.</p>
<p>In addition to the bets marked on the table, there are some additional
bets. Some of these are called
odds bets, or free odds bets, and pay off at
odds that depend on the dice, not on the bet itself. An odds bet must be
associated with a bet called a line bet, and are said to be
“behind” the original bet; they can be called “behind the
line” bets. The four line bets will be defined more fully, below.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Casino Variation</p>
<p>There are slight variations in the bets available in different
casinos. We’ll focus on a common subset of bets.</p>
</div>
<p>The dice form a frequency distribution with values from 2 to 12. An
interesting preliminary exercise is to produce a table of this
distribution with a small demonstration program. This frequency
distribution is central to understanding the often cryptic rules for
Craps. See <a class="reference internal" href="#craps-ov-freq"><span class="std std-ref">Creating A Dice Frequency Distribution</span></a> for a small application to develop this
frequency distribution.</p>

<h2>Game State Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#game-state-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Craps game has two states: <strong>point off</strong> and
<strong>point on</strong>. When a player begins a game, the point is off;
the initial throw of the dice is called the “come out roll”. The
number thrown on the dice determines the next state, and also the bets
that win or lose. The rules are detailed in the following table.</p>

</table>
<p>There is a symmetry to these rules. The most frequent number, 7, is
either an immediate winner or an immediate loser. The next most frequent
numbers are the six point numbers, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, which form three
sets: 4 and 10 are high odds, 5 and 9 are middle odds, 6 and 8 are low
odds. The relatively rare numbers (2, 3, 11 and 12) are handled
specially on the first roll only, otherwise they are ignored. Because of
the small distinction made between the <em>craps</em> numbers (2, 3
and 12), and 11, there is an obscure “C-E” bet to cover both
craps and eleven.</p>

<span id="craps-details-bets"></span><h2>Available Bets<a class="headerlink" href="#available-bets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are four broad classification of bets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>those which follow the sequence of dice throws that make up a complete game,</p></li>
<li><p>those based on just the next throw of the dice (called proposition bets),</p></li>

<p>The game bets are also called line bets, can be supplemented with additional odds bets, placed
behind the line bet.  There are actually two sets of game bets based on the pass line and the come line.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows half of a typical craps table
layout. On the left are the game bets. On the right (in the center of
the table) are the single-roll propositions.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Craps Table Layout</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Game Bets</strong>.
The Game bets have two states.  There is a set of bets allowed for the
first roll, called the “come out” roll.  If a point is established
a number of additional bets become available.  These are the pass line
bets.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic pass line bets, there are also come line
bets, which are similar to game bets.</p>
<p><strong>Come Out Roll</strong>.
When the point is <em>off</em>, the player will be making the come
out roll, and only a subset of bets are available. Once the point is <em>on</em>,
all bets are available.</p>
<p>The bets which are allowed on the come out roll are the Pass Line
and Don’t Pass Line bets. These bets follow the action of
the player’s game. There are several possible outcomes for these two bets.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Player throws craps (2, 3, or 12). A Pass Line bet loses. A Don’t
Pass Line bet wins even money on 2 or 3; however, on 12, it returns
the bet. This last case is called a “push” ; this rule is
noted on the table by the “bar 12” legend in the Don’t Pass area.</p></li>
<li><p>Player throws 7 or 11. A Pass Line bet wins even money. A Don’t Pass
Line bet loses.</p></li>
<li><p>Player throws a point number. The point is now <em>on</em>. A
large white token, marked “on” is placed in one of the six
numbered boxes to announce the point. The player can now place an
additional odds bet behind the line. Placing a bet behind the Pass
Line is called “buying odds on the point”. Placing a bet
behind the Don’t Pass Line is called “laying odds against the point”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Point Rolls</strong>.
Once the point is on, there are three possible outcomes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The player makes the point before rolling 7. A Pass Line bet
wins even money. A Don’t Pass Line bet loses. The point
determines the odds used to pay the behind the Pass Line odds bet.</p></li>
<li><p>The player throws 7 before making the point. A Pass Line bet
loses. A Don’t Pass Line bet pays even money. The point
determines the odds used to pay the behind the Don’t Pass Line
odds bet.</p></li>
<li><p>The player throws a number other than 7 and the point: the game continues.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Come Line Bets</strong>.
Once the point is on, the bets labeled “Come” and
“Don’t Come” are allowed. These bets effectively form a game
parallel to the main game, using a come point instead of the main game
point. Instead of dropping the large “on” token in a numbered
square on the layout, the house will move the individual Come and Don’t
Come bets from their starting line into the numbered boxes (4, 5, 6, 8,
9, 10) to show which bets are placed on each point number. There are
several possible outcomes for these two bets.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Player throws craps (2, 3, or 12). A Come Line bet loses. There are
some additional special cases: a Don’t
Come bet wins even money on 2 or 3; it is a push on 12. Established
come point bets in the numbered squares remain.</p></li>
<li><p>Player throws 11. A Come Line bet wins even money. A Don’t Come bet
loses. Established come point bets in the numbered squares remain.</p></li>
<li><p>Player throws a point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10). Any come bets
in that numbered box are winners – the come point was made – and
the point determines the odds used to pay the behind the line odds.
(Note that if this is the point for the main game, there will be no
bets in the box, instead the large “on” token will be sitting
there.) New bets are moved from the Come Line and Don’t Come Line to
the numbered box, indicating that this bet is waiting on that point
number to be made. Additional behind the line odds bets can now be
placed. If the main game’s point was made, the “on” token
will be removed (and flipped over to say “off”), and the
next roll will be a come out roll for the main game. These bets
(with the exception of the free odds behind a Come Line bet) are
still working bets.</p></li>
<li><p>The player throws 7 before making the main point. A Come bet loses.
A Don’t Come bet pays even money. The bets in the numbered boxes are
all losers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Propositions</strong>.
There are also a number of one-roll propositions,
including the individual numbers 2, 3, 7, 11, 12; also field
(2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 or 12), any craps (2, 3 or 12), the horn
(2, 3, 11 or 12), and a hop bet. These bets have no
minimum, allowing a player to cover a number of them inexpensively.</p>
<p><strong>Hardways</strong>.
There are four hardways bets. These are bets that 4, 6, 8 or 10 will
come up on two equal die (the hard way) before they come up on two
unequal die (the easy way) or before a 7 is rolled. Hard 6, for example,
is a bet that the pair (3,3) will be rolled before any of the other four
combinations (1,5), (2,4), (5,1), (4,2) that total 6, or any of the 6
combinations that total 7. These bets can only be placed when the point
is on, but they are neither single-roll propositions, nor are they tied
to the game point.</p>
<p><strong>Unmarked Bets</strong>.
There are additional unmarked bets. One is to make a “place bet”
on a number; these bets have a different set of odds than the odds bets
behind a line bet. Other unmarked bets are to “buy” a number or “lay”
a number, both of which involve paying a commission on the bet.
Typically, only the six and eight are bought, and they can only be
bought when they are not the point.</p>
<p>For programmers new to casino gambling, see <a class="reference internal" href="#craps-bg-odds"><span class="std std-ref">Odds and Payouts</span></a> for
more information on odds payments for the various kinds of bets.</p>
<div class="sidebar" id="craps-bg-odds">
<p class="sidebar-title">Odds and Payouts</p>
<p>Not all of the Craps outcomes are equal probability. Some of the
bets pay fixed odds, defined as part of the bet. Other bets pay
odds that depend on the point established.</p>
<p>The basic Pass Line, Don’t Pass, Come Line and Don’t Come bets
are even money bets. A $5 bet wins an additional $5.</p>
<p>The odds of winning a Pass Line bet is 49.3%. The <img class="math" src="../_images/math/47597694b86443e4806abd0eebe5b0f1ae6a0d7b.png" alt="1:1"/> payout
presumes a 50% chance of winning. The gap between
actual odds and payout is the house edge.</p>
<p>The points have distinct odds, as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 and 10 have odds of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/aee77caba29dca6399c5ceb96e133ba33aea644e.png" alt="\tfrac{3}{36}"/> to win, <img class="math" src="../_images/math/2473b08ff30382967a6da9c5b96679e929ec2350.png" alt="\tfrac{6}{36}"/> to lose,
otherwise the game continues. This is a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/d1170514c898ee4291bdfbcb59914e3d982760e5.png" alt="1:2"/> payout.</p></li>
<li><p>5 and 9 have odds of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/5159b34e8c92dac26669f852b31a4cd172ddf244.png" alt="\tfrac{4}{36}"/> to win, leading to a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/02022dc7fad858c6684a880d113bb38ce876e930.png" alt="4: 6 = 2:3"/> payout.</p></li>
<li><p>6 and 8 have odds of <img class="math" src="../_images/math/6cd83a940d7ff5d5256ccf39bcfbaa82c396e4f0.png" alt="\tfrac{5}{36}"/> to win. this is a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/7caea0e38d65a4b05509d5e281c7bb70294f1f3e.png" alt="5:6"/> payout.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these behind-the-line odds bets has a correct payout to
match the actual odds of winning.</p>
<p>The combination of a Pass Line bet plus odds behind the line
narrows the house edge. For example, a bet on the
Pass Line has an expected return of -1.414%. If we place double
odds behind the line with an expected return of 0, the net
expected return for the combination is -0.471%.</p>
<p>The various proposition bets have odds stated on the table. Note
that these rarely reflect the actual odds of winning. For
example, a bet on 12 is a <img class="math" src="../_images/math/85070a0f351fad0c6746d4e7eb95bf32d17ab76f.png" alt="\tfrac{1}{36}"/> probability, but only
pays as if it were <img class="math" src="../_images/math/2a616c973c9f2c2baaa1273baf060d1510d1232e.png" alt="\tfrac{1}{30}"/>.</p>
<p>There are <img class="math" src="../_images/math/85070a0f351fad0c6746d4e7eb95bf32d17ab76f.png" alt="\tfrac{1}{36}"/> ways to win a hard six or hard eight bet,
and <img class="math" src="../_images/math/2c18432a84c42076a07b7508b0caf2372a200798.png" alt="\tfrac{10}{36}"/>. The remaining 25 outcomes are indeterminate.
While a hard 6 or hard 8 should pay <img class="math" src="../_images/math/d2656d16b8678f9b4b289ed1724165c2cd622d0e.png" alt="10:1"/>, the actual payment is
<img class="math" src="../_images/math/7e1eb5992befe2bc70ca4372ca0349eb3970ab05.png" alt="9:1"/>. Similarly for a hard 4 or hard 10: they should pay <img class="math" src="../_images/math/e342128e9a64c26c7f9487fa2f25bc9a840aad6e.png" alt="8:1"/>, the

<p>All of the Roulette betting strategies apply to Craps. However, the
additional complication of Craps is the ability to have multiple working
bets. The player can add bets during the game. The most important of
these additional bets are the behind the line odds bets. Since these are
paid at proper odds, they are the most desirable bets on the layout. The
player, therefore, should place a line bet, followed by a behind the
line odds bet.</p>
<p>The other commonly used additional bets are the Come bets.
These increase the number of working bets. Since the additional
odds bets for these pay proper odds, they are also highly desirable. A
player can place a Come bet, followed by a behind the line odds bet on
the specific number rolled.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the bets are less interesting. All of the proposition
and hardways bets have odds that are incorrect. We can simulate these
bets to discover the house edge built into the incorrect odds.</p>
<p>Some players will count the number of throws in
game, and place a “7” bet if the game lasts more than six throws.
This is a form of betting against oneself. When the player has a Pass Line bet
that the game will be won, they’re diluted this with a 7 bet that the game will be
lost. While the common rationale is that the second bet protects against
a loss, it also reduces the potential win. We can simulate this kind of
betting and examine the potential outcomes.</p>

<h2>Wrong Betting<a class="headerlink" href="#wrong-betting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Craps has two forms of odds betting: “right” and “wrong”. The Pass
Line and Come Line, as well as buying odds, are all “right”.
The Don’t Pass, Don’t Come and Laying Odds are all “wrong”.</p>
<p>Right betting involves odds that provide a large reward for a
small wager. The odds on a Pass Line bet for the number 4 are
<img class="math" src="../_images/math/2da4d58abd68781dcdd0b97ac1adbaaf01695038.png" alt="2:1"/>: they player can win double the bet if the point is made.
The bet is to put 10 at risk to make 20.</p>
<p>Wrong betting involves odds that provide a small reward for a
large wager. The odds on a Don’t Pass Line bet for the number 4
are described as “laid at 2:1”; the player will win half of what was bet if the point is missed.
The player puts 20 at risk to make 10.</p>
<p>This distinction can be ignored by novice programmers. None of our
simulated players are wrong bettors, since this involves putting a large
amount at risk for a small payout, which violates a basic rule
of gambling:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Never risk a lot to win a little.</strong></p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>Looking Forward<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-forward" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve considered the details of the craps game, we’ll
need to look at the overall structure of the solution. It’s important
to consider how the classes will interact with each other. Each class,
in isolation, does very little. The aggregation of those classes will
provide the required behavior.</p>
<p>The next chapter will propose an initial set of classes, and some
revisions to classes we’ve already written.</p>
