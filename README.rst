The Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design Book: Step-by-Step Construction of A Complete Application.

This repository contains the full text of the book, plus
some of the source code examples.

The idea behind this book is for you to write the code.
If the book provides too much code, you don't have to do the work.
The point is to give you some work as a way to learn coding and design skills.

Think of any kind of sport. Watching the sport -- while fun -- isn't the
same as actually participating.

This book is like multiple seasons of play in your favorite sport.
Each chapter is a separate game.
You must work your through the game, finding the winning strategy.
Since you're not in the Olympics, speed doesn't matter, and you get
as many retries in each game as you need.

Thank you for your interest.
